## My Love for Tech Tools

### Description
Think about how much our lives have changed because of tech. When you mix in some coding skills with the latest gadgets and tools, you can significantly improve upon your skills in the subject.Without the right tools, coding becomes a chore, something that you are forced to do, and it will be hard to improve at.

Take Computational Biology, for instance. This field brilliantly fuses biology with computer science. By harnessing the right tools and software, researchers can delve into intricate DNA sequences, simulate cellular processes, and even predict potential health risks.

- **GitHub**: The go-to platform for version control and collaboration. I'e been loving this since 2019, it helped me install homebrew on my 3ds and Nintendo Switch.

- **Visual Studio Code (VSCode)**: The code editor we will be using that supports multiple programming languages and has a plethora of plugins. 

- **Jupyter Notebooks**: An interactive platform for running code, analyzing data, and documenting your work.

- **Slack**: Our communication tool. Important announcements and daily messages will be shared here.

- **WSL**: Windows Subsystem for Linux provides a Linux-like terminal on Windows.
