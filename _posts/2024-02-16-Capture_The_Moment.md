# Capturing the Moment: A Reflection on Our Journey Through Night at the Museum

## Two Trimester Focus Planning

### Leveraging N@tM for Test Data

During N@tM, we closely observed and interacted with participants to gather qualitative feedback on the game's understandability and accessibility. One key insight was the need for a tutorial explaining the gameplay mechanics and overall simulation process. This feedback has become a cornerstone for our next steps, highlighting the importance of user-friendly features for enhancing game experience.

### Planned Additions from Feedback

Encouraged by the event's feedback, we're excited to announce a significant upcoming feature: a multiplayer function. This addition will allow multiple participants to join a league and compete throughout the season, adding a new layer of engagement and competition to our simulation.

## Reflection on glows/grows from your demo/presentations

Reflecting on our presentation, the interactive nature of our demo stood out as a major glow. The enthusiasm and engagement from the audience surpassed our expectations, affirming the captivating appeal of our project. Our team's deep understanding of the simulation allowed us to effectively communicate complex concepts in an accessible manner.

However, we recognized a growth area in ensuring a consistent experience for all visitors. Our aim for the next showcase is to provide a uniform introduction to both the drafting page and the individual statistics page, ensuring every participant receives a comprehensive view of our project.

### Something you saw in CompSci that impressed

A standout project from the CompSci section was a chat web app by Krishiv, Parav, and Shaurya. This innovative platform connects students based on shared classes, facilitating homework help and collaborative learning. The concept impressed us with its potential to significantly ease and enhance the academic experience.I would have loved for a tool like this in my highschool career.

### Something you saw outside of CompSci that you liked

Bhargav Bhadri's montage of New York Streets and Kyrie Irving captured my admiration. Bhargav's artistic expression of his love for Brooklyn through this beautifully produced montage, combined with his admiration for Kyrie's basketball prowess, showcased a unique blend of personal passion and creative talent. I've known Bhargav for a long time, and if there are two things that he enjoys, its basketball and NYC, so him expressing this artistically was joyful.

In conclusion, the Night at the Museum event has been a cornerstone for our project's development, providing invaluable feedback and insights. As we move forward, the lessons learned and the inspirations drawn will guide us in refining our NBA Draft Simulator, making it more engaging, accessible, and enjoyable for all users. The journey continues, and we are more excited than ever to see where it takes us.
