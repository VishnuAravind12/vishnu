# Memories and Learning Moments

- As I reflect on the first trimester, I'm reminded of the challenges I faced jumping into AP Computer Science A without the foundational experience of AP CSP at Del Norte. The absence of basic knowledge like markdown formatting and a lack of familiarity with the HTML/CSS/JavaScript trio presented significant hurdles from the start. The expectation to immediately engage in coding with these tools was overwhelming. However, my teammate Akshat extended a helping hand, guiding me through the complexities of these new tools. His support was a beacon that led me from confusion to clarity, enabling me to tackle tasks that once seemed daunting. This experience highlighted the power of collaboration and the impact of having a supportive team.
- My introduction to Java was much more of a tranquil journey. Since it was uncharted territory for all of us, I was on equal footing with my peers. The structured unit lessons provided a comprehensive understanding of Java's fundamentals and the principles of object-oriented programming (OOP). This methodical learning process allowed me to steadily grow in confidence and skill. I'm happy that I am familiar with the fundementals of Java, as now, I can code in a language that is much less resource intensive than a language like Python.
- During the first trimester, a defining moment was collaborating with Akshat to build a web application that calculated NBA players' fantasy scores using a custom formula and data from an NBA API. This project was my introduction to data analytics in the classroom. We delved into the intricacies of the API, debated the weight of player statistics, and crafted an algorithm that balanced various performance metrics. Seeing our application accurately reflect players' on-court contributions was a rewarding testament to our teamwork and analytical skills.

# Key Achievements

Over the trimester, I embarked on a challenging yet fulfilling journey, culminating in the successful implementation of a multi-variable regression algorithm within a Spring Boot framework. This algorithm was designed to predict students' grades based on their GitHub statistics, integrating various data points to produce a comprehensive analytical tool. The project not only honed my technical skills but also deepened my understanding of predictive modeling and its practical applications in educational settings.

Throughout the trimester, my engagement with the team was both active and constructive. I consistently participated in preparing for live reviews. I also played a role (but I would like to play a bigger role next trimester) in the ideation process, helping to brainstorm and refine our project concepts.

# Looking Ahead

Looking ahead, I am keen to deepen my understanding of the mathematical principles behind various algorithms, such as clustering algorithms, logistic regression, and neural networks, and how to implement these from scratch in Java. I'm also intrigued by the intricacies of pathfinding algorithms and their applications. I also want to understand the intricacies of the Spring Boot framework in greater detail, and take more of an active stance in the ideation process.

# Areas for Growth

As for opportunities for growth, I recognize the need to fully comprehend the Spring Boot framework and its ecosystem. The introduction of tools like Lombok and Maven in class was a clear indicator of the evolving landscape of Java development. I intend to be more proactive in integrating such tools into my projects, enhancing both efficiency and understanding. This proactive approach will be crucial as I navigate the complexities of modern software development and strive for excellence in my coding journey.
