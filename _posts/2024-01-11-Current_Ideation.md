## Introduction:

Overview of Parkinson's Disease and the significance of miRNA biomarkers.
Aim: Develop a Java neural network for accurate classification of these biomarkers, integrating miRBase data via REST API.
Project Objective:

Create a reliable, Java-based tool to aid in the early detection of Parkinson’s Disease through miRNA biomarker classification.
Utilize REST API to access and process data from miRBase.

## Data Source:

Primary Database: miRBase (http://www.mirbase.org/)
Access Method: REST API queries (e.g., http://www.mirbase.org/...).

## Tools and Libraries:

Neural Network Library: Deeplearning4j
Data Processing: Apache Commons, Jackson JSON Processor
REST API Development: Spring Boot, Jersey

## Neural Network Development in Java:

## Data Retrieval and Preprocessing:

Use Jersey client for REST API calls to miRBase.
Utilize Jackson for JSON parsing.
Clean data using Apache Commons.

## Designing the Neural Network:

Implement a Multilayer Perceptron (MLP) using Deeplearning4j.
Configure layers: Input layer (size based on miRNA features), hidden layers (experiment with 2-3 layers), output layer (2 neurons for classification).

## Training the Model:

Develop feature space for miRNA custom data object (Sequence Descriptors, Genetic Target Descriptors).
Split data into training and test sets (80/20 ratio).
Train the model using backpropagation and stochastic gradient descent.
Tune hyperparameters: learning rate, batch size, number of epochs.

## Model Evaluation:

Use Deeplearning4j’s evaluation class to assess accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score.
Implement cross-validation for robustness.

## REST API Integration:

Develop a Spring Boot application for REST API.
Endpoint for model prediction: POST /classifyMiRNA
Deploy locally or use cloud services like AWS for hosting.

## Testing and Validation:

Perform validation using separate datasets.
Collaborate with medical researchers for real-world data testing.

## Conclusion:

Potential impact in medical diagnostics.
Future enhancements: integrating additional databases, improving model accuracy.
