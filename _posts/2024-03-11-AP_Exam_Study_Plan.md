# AP Computer Science A Study Plan
With the AP CSA exam on the horizon on 5/13/2024, I have structured a comprehensive study plan to ensure I cover all necessary material and hone my computational thinking practices. Given today's date is 3/11/2024, I have approximately two months to prepare. Here's how I plan to tackle the preparation:

## Weeks 1-2: Review Units 1-2
Focus: Primitive Types, Using Objects
Tasks:

- Review Java primitive types, data manipulation, and the usage of objects and classes.
- Practice coding exercises to strengthen my understanding of object-oriented programming concepts.
- Computational Thinking Practices: Focus on Program Design and Algorithm Development, and Code Logic.

## Weeks 3-4: Dive Deep into Units 3-4
Focus: Boolean Expressions and if Statements, Iteration
Tasks:

- Practice boolean logic (De Morgan's Law), control structures, and the use of if-else statements.
- Master loops (for, while, do-while) and understand their applications.
- Computational Thinking Practices: Emphasize Code Logic and Code Testing.

## Week 5: Concentrate on Units 5-6
Focus: Writing Classes, Array
Tasks:

- Learn to write my own classes, focusing on encapsulation and designing robust classes.
- Understand arrays thoroughly, including declaration, instantiation, and traversal.
- Computational Thinking Practices: Program Design and Algorithm Development.

## Week 6: Focus on Units 7-8
Focus: ArrayList, 2D Array
Tasks:

- Get comfortable with ArrayLists, differences between arrays and ArrayLists, and when to use each.
- Dive into 2D arrays, their usage, and traversals.
- Computational Thinking Practices: Code Logic and Code Testing.

## Week 7: Master Units 9-10
Focus: Inheritance, Recursion
Tasks:

- Understand the principles of inheritance and how to apply them.
- Learn the basics of recursion, how recursive solutions are formed, and common examples.
- Computational Thinking Practices: Program Design and Algorithm Development, Code Logic.

## Week 8: Review and Practice Exams
Focus: Comprehensive Review
Tasks:

- Review all units, focusing on weaker areas.
- Take timed practice exams to simulate test conditions and identify areas needing improvement.
Computational Thinking Practices: All, with emphasis on Code Testing and Documentation.

## Weeks 9-10: Final Preparations
Focus: Targeted Review and Practice
Tasks:

- Focus on computational thinking practices not assessed in the multiple-choice section by coding projects.
- Continue practicing with timed exams, review explanations for questions I got wrong.
Engage in peer discussions, tutoring sessions, or study groups to clarify doubts.

## Daily Activities
- Optimize Note Revision: Implement active review techniques when revisiting old notes. Transform key points into quiz questions or flashcards, engaging in self-testing to reinforce memory recall.
- Elevate New Material Note-taking: Integrate a dual-coding approach by combining written notes with relevant diagrams or code snippets. Use color coding to highlight critical concepts, differences, and connections.
