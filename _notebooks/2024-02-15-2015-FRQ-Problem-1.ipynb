    "From our Group Final Project, specifically the Logistic Regression Model, the above is an excerpt of code that really showcases the capabilities of ArrayLists in Java. The model is used, in tandem with a linear regressor, to project a player's stats. The key part of the code that highlights the use of ArrayLists is in the `train` method, where we update the coefficients and intercept for the regression model. This part is crucial because it iteratively adjusts the model parameters based on the training data to improve the model's predictions.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this excerpt, I used ArrayLists to manage and dynamically update the coefficients and slope gradients. Unlike fixed-size arrays, ArrayLists in Java can resize dynamically, which is particularly useful in machine learning contexts like ours where the number of features (and thus coefficients) can vary.\n",
    "\n",
    "Moreover, the ease of accessing and modifying elements in an ArrayList is demonstrated in this section of the code. Through the use of the `get` and `set` methods, I efficiently update the slope gradients and coefficients during each iteration of the training process.\n",
    "\n",
    "Another significant aspect of using ArrayLists here is their ability to store complex data types, like `Double` objects in our case. This feature is especially useful in data science and machine learning applications, where handling floating-point numbers is common."
