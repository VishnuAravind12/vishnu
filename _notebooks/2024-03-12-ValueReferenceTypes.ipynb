    "# Introduction\n",
    "- In Java, there are two main types of data types primitive/value types and reference types.  \n",
    "- We will be using the terms stack and heap here to describe memory allocation. \n",
    "    - The stack: Temporary memory were were values are stored and methods called,after a method has finished executing the memory is cleared.\n",
    "    - The heap: The heap memory is the memory created by th JVM when it is started and is used while the application is still running, it is used to allocate memory to objects and JRE classes.\n",
    "    - [Learn More](https://stackify.com/java-heap-vs-stack/#:~:text=Java%20Heap%20Space%20is%20used,be%20accessed%20throughout%20the%20application)\n",
    "- This is not typically present explicitly in any CollegeBoard questions however is a recurring theme that will need to be understood to be able to understand and solve problems on the exam.\n",

    "# Reference Types\n",
    "\n",
    "## General Information\n",
    "- Reference types are a subclass of the java.lang.Object class.\n",
    "- Reference types can be defined by the user\n",
    "- When two references are assigned to each other the will both point to the same object in memory.\n",
    "- When objects are passed into an object the method changes the content of the object but not the location of the object in memory.\n",
    "- A reference type is a reference to the actual data, that is they allow for us to be able to access objects stored elsewhere in memory. What typically occurs when we create a reference type the object is stored onto the stack and the value that corresponds to the object is stored in the heap. For instance if we create a Cat class: "

    "### (a) Primitive Types and Reference Types in Java\n",
    "\n",
    "In Java, there are two major categories of data types: primitive types and reference types.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Primitive Types:** These are the most basic kinds of data types and directly contain values. Java provides 8 primitive types which include `byte`, `short`, `int`, `long`, `float`, `double`, `char`, and `boolean`. They are stored in the call stack, which allows for fast access but has a limited size.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Examples:**\n",
    "  - `int age = 30;` (An integer value)\n",
    "  - `double salary = 5000.00;` (A double precision floating-point number)\n",
    "  - `boolean isEmployed = true;` (A boolean value true or false)\n",
    "\n",
    "**Reference Types:** These include any data type that derives from a class or an interface, including arrays. Reference types do not store the actual value, but a reference (or address) to the memory where the value is stored. This memory location is in the heap, which is a larger, but slower-to-access memory area.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Examples:**\n",
    "  - `String name = \"John Doe\";` (A String object)\n",
    "  - `Integer ageObject = new Integer(30);` (An Integer object)\n",
    "  - `Customer customer = new Customer();` (A Customer object, assuming a Customer class exists)\n",
    "\n",
    "### (b) Differences Between Primitive Types and Reference Types\n",
    "\n",
    "**Memory Allocation:**\n",
    "- **Primitive Types:** Stored directly in the stack. The stack is more efficient but has less space. Each primitive type has a fixed size; for example, an `int` is always 4 bytes.\n",
    "- **Reference Types:** The reference (or address) is stored in the stack, but the actual object is stored in the heap. The heap has more space but is slower to access. The size of a reference type can vary depending on the object's attributes.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Usage:**\n",
    "- **Primitive Types:** Used for basic data and cannot be null. Operations on primitive types are generally faster due to direct value access.\n",
    "- **Reference Types:** Can represent more complex data structures and can be null. They support methods (behaviors) and fields (states).\n",
