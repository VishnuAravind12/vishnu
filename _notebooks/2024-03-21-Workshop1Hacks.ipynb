    "### (a) Concept of Iteration over a 2D Array in Java\n",
    "\n",
    "Iteration over a 2D array involves traversing through the array's elements, which are arranged in rows and columns, similar to a matrix. In Java, a 2D array is an array of arrays. To iterate over a 2D array, you typically use nested loops: the outer loop iterates over each row (array), and the inner loop iterates over each element (column) within that row.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example Scenario:**\n",
    "Iterating over a 2D array is particularly useful in scenarios involving grid-like data structures, such as game boards (chess, tic-tac-toe), pixel matrices in images, and in your case, tracking player scores across different levels and attempts in a game. For instance, in a tic-tac-toe game, a 2D array can represent the game board where each cell holds a value indicating an empty spot, a \"X\", or a \"O\". Iterating over this array allows the program to check for win conditions, draw the board, or update it.\n",
    "\n",
    "### (b) Code: `calculateTotalScore` Method\n",
    "\n",
    "Below is the implementation of the `calculateTotalScore` method. This method takes a 2D array of integers as input, representing player scores across different levels and attempts. It returns the sum of all scores by iterating through each element in the 2D array."

    "## Primitive Types vs Reference Types Hacks\n",
    "\n",
    "### (a) Primitive Types and Reference Types in Java\n",
    "\n",
    "In Java, there are two major categories of data types: primitive types and reference types.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Primitive Types:** These are the most basic kinds of data types and directly contain values. Java provides 8 primitive types which include `byte`, `short`, `int`, `long`, `float`, `double`, `char`, and `boolean`. They are stored in the call stack, which allows for fast access but has a limited size.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Examples:**\n",
    "  - `int age = 30;` (An integer value)\n",
    "  - `double salary = 5000.00;` (A double precision floating-point number)\n",
    "  - `boolean isEmployed = true;` (A boolean value true or false)\n",
    "\n",
    "**Reference Types:** These include any data type that derives from a class or an interface, including arrays. Reference types do not store the actual value, but a reference (or address) to the memory where the value is stored. This memory location is in the heap, which is a larger, but slower-to-access memory area.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Examples:**\n",
    "  - `String name = \"John Doe\";` (A String object)\n",
    "  - `Integer ageObject = new Integer(30);` (An Integer object)\n",
    "  - `Customer customer = new Customer();` (A Customer object, assuming a Customer class exists)\n",
    "\n",
    "### (b) Differences Between Primitive Types and Reference Types\n",
    "\n",
    "**Memory Allocation:**\n",
    "- **Primitive Types:** Stored directly in the stack. The stack is more efficient but has less space. Each primitive type has a fixed size; for example, an `int` is always 4 bytes.\n",
    "- **Reference Types:** The reference (or address) is stored in the stack, but the actual object is stored in the heap. The heap has more space but is slower to access. The size of a reference type can vary depending on the object's attributes.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Usage:**\n",
    "- **Primitive Types:** Used for basic data and cannot be null. Operations on primitive types are generally faster due to direct value access.\n",
    "- **Reference Types:** Can represent more complex data structures and can be null. They support methods (behaviors) and fields (states).\n",

    "\n",
    "### (a) Definition and Significance of Arrays in Java\n",
    "\n",
    "An **array** in Java is a container object that holds a fixed number of values of a single type. The length of an array is established when the array is created and cannot be changed after creation. Each item in an array is called an element, and each element is accessed by its numerical index, with the first element being at index 0.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Significance and Usefulness:**\n",
    "Arrays are fundamental data structures in programming, used to store collections of data. They are particularly useful when there is a need to organize data for easy access by a numeric index. Here are some key points that highlight the significance of arrays:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Efficiency:** Arrays are stored in contiguous memory locations, which makes accessing elements by their index very efficient.\n",
    "- **Simplicity:** Arrays provide a straightforward way to implement and manage collections of variables of the same type.\n",
    "- **Use Cases:** Arrays are used in a wide range of applications, from simple data storage to being the building blocks for more complex data structures. They are especially useful in scenarios where the number of elements is known beforehand, and elements need to be quickly accessed by index.\n",
