    "In developing the `HiddenWord` class, I focused on encapsulating both the data and the logic required for the game within a single, cohesive class structure.\n",
    "\n",
    "The `HiddenWord` class centers around a private instance variable `HiddenWord`, which stores the word to be guessed. This encapsulation of the hidden word within the class ensures that the integrity of the game's core data is maintained, as it can't be accessed or modified directly from outside the class. In the constructor of `HiddenWord`, I initialized the `HiddenWord` variable. This constructor is a fundamental aspect of class design, as it sets up the initial state of the object when it's created.\n",
    "\n",
    "The `getHint` method is where the primary logic of the game resides. This method compares the user's guess with the hidden word and constructs a hint based on specific rules. By iterating over each character of the guess and comparing it with the corresponding character in the hidden word, the method effectively uses control structures to build the hint. \n",
    "\n",
    "In the initial development of the `HiddenWord` class, I utilized a simple `String` to create the hint in the `getHint` method. However, I soon realized that this approach was not the most efficient, particularly in terms of memory management. Every time a new character was added to the hint, using a `String` would create a new `String` object in memory. After some research, I came across the `StringBuilder` class, a mutable sequence of characters. `StringBuilder` allows for the dynamic modification of its contents without creating new objects each time something is appended to it. Now, instead of creating a new string each time a character is added, I simply modify the existing `StringBuilder` object. This change not only optimizes the memory usage but also makes the code cleaner.\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, the main method transforms this class into an interactive game. By incorporating a Scanner to take user inputs and using a loop to allow continuous guessing, I created an engaging user experience. The loop checks for correct guesses and congratulates the user upon success."
