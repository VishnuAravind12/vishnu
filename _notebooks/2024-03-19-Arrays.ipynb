    "**Element** is a single value within the array\n",
    "The **index of an element** is the position of the element within the array\n",
    "    - For Java, the first element is at index 0\n",

    "# Common Mistakes\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Failure to use the `intValue()` method.\n",
    "   - This is important because Java by default stores data in arrayLists using wrapper classes liek `Interger`. In this case the wrapper class needs to be converted into a primitive `int` datatype to perform operations on it.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Failure to use `num % 10` or `num /= 10`.\n",
    "   - These lines are meant to target the last digit to either add to the arrayList or to remove from the integer \n",

    "### (a) Definition and Significance of Arrays in Java\n",
    "\n",
    "An **array** in Java is a container object that holds a fixed number of values of a single type. The length of an array is established when the array is created and cannot be changed after creation. Each item in an array is called an element, and each element is accessed by its numerical index, with the first element being at index 0.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Significance and Usefulness:**\n",
    "Arrays are fundamental data structures in programming, used to store collections of data. They are particularly useful when there is a need to organize data for easy access by a numeric index. Here are some key points that highlight the significance of arrays:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Efficiency:** Arrays are stored in contiguous memory locations, which makes accessing elements by their index very efficient.\n",
    "- **Simplicity:** Arrays provide a straightforward way to implement and manage collections of variables of the same type.\n",
    "- **Use Cases:** Arrays are used in a wide range of applications, from simple data storage to being the building blocks for more complex data structures. They are especially useful in scenarios where the number of elements is known beforehand, and elements need to be quickly accessed by index.\n",
    "- **Looping:** Arrays can be easily iterated over using loops, making them ideal for processing collections of data.\n",

    "- The method first checks if the `grades` array is `null` or empty (`grades.length == 0`) and returns `0.0` in such cases to avoid division by zero or processing an invalid array.\n",
    "- It then iterates over each grade in the array, adding each grade to a cumulative sum.\n",
    "- After iterating through all grades, the method calculates the average by dividing the total sum by the number of grades in the array.\n",
    "- The calculated average is returned as a `double`. This ensures that the average is precise even when the division result is not a whole number."
