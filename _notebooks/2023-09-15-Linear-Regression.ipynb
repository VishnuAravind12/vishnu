    "In our context, we're trying to predict a student's grade (dependent variable) based on the number of commits they've made (independent variable). Mathematically, this relationship is represented as Grade=mÃ—Commits+c, where m is the slope and c is the y-intercept. The slope m indicates how much the grade changes for each additional commit, while c represents the grade when there are no commits. The code calculates m and c using the method of least squares, which minimizes the sum of the squared differences between the observed grades and the grades predicted by the model. Once we have the values of m and c, we can predict the grade for any given number of commits."
