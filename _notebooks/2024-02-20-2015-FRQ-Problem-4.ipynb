This part of the problem allowed me to apply basic control structures and demonstrate how they can be used to define specific behaviors in a class.\n",

This step was essential to calculate the mean fantasy points, laying the groundwork for further calculations. We then used another loop to compute the sum of squared differences from the mean, a critical step in determining the variance of the players' performances. Finally, the standard deviation was derived by taking the square root of this variance."
