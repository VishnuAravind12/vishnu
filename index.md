## Hey there!

I'm Vishnu Aravind, a Sacramento Kings fan and I like biology. In terms of CS, my favorite topic is ML.

- Here is a link to my [github](https://github.com/VishnuAravind12).
- Here are my classes: AP CSA, AP Gov, AP Stats, AP E and M, and Expos.

Just started with GitHub Pages and learned how to use Markdown. Here's an image that depicts who I am as a person. I have a passion for basketball, and I love to get in the gym and work on my vertical. I also love AI and computational biology. But family is definitely the most important thing for me.
